Introduction
Plastic pollution is a significant environmental issue. Automating the detection of plastic bottles in natural settings can assist in cleanup efforts and reduce pollution. This project leverages machine learning to identify plastic bottles in images.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project comprises images containing plastic bottles and other objects. Data augmentation techniques were applied to enhance the model's robustness.

Model Architecture
The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, implemented with YOLOv5, known for real-time object detection capabilities.

Training
Training was conducted on a dataset of labeled images, with the following parameters:

Epochs: 50
Batch Size: 16
Learning Rate: 0.001
The training process utilized data augmentation and early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix was generated to visualize classification performance.

Results
The trained model achieved the following results on the test set:

Precision: 95%
Recall: 93%
F1-Score: 94%
These metrics indicate the model's high accuracy in detecting plastic bottles.
